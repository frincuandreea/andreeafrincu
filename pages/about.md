Hello,

my name isÂ Andreea Frincu. I started this blog to write about topics software development. I just want to 
share with everybody interesting implementations tasks that maybe you also have to do them. My purpose is to write about topics which are interesting or they are repeating every time.

I work as a Software Developer in various projects. During the years I worked on backend projects but also on frontend projects.
I learn a lot during working with awesome teams and I am still open to learn new things. 

In my free time I like to code new small projects or try ideas, read books, walk and help others.
