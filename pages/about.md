Hello,

my name isÂ Andreea Frincu (now Ciapsa). I work as a Software Developer in various projects. During the years I worked on backend projects but also on frontend projects.
I learn a lot during working with awesome teams and I am still open to learn new things. 

In my free time I like to code, read books, walk and help others.
