My name is Andreea (Frincu) Ciapsa and I am a Software Developer since 2010. 

During the years I worked on projects which involve frontend development but also backend development. I have learn so much and also in current days I am still learning. I always say to myself that life is about continuously learning and learning again.  

Since 2016 I start working on AEM. I found it really interesting and challenging the AEM development and the complexity of the CMS systems in general. 
​

Skills:

* Java, Java Enterprise Edition, Spring boot

* AEM, Glassfish, Apache, Tomcat, JBoss Application Server

* EJB, OSGI bundles

* JSF

* REST, SOAP

* JPA, Hibernate, Oracle, MySql, PLSql

* Javascript, JQuery, AngularJS, RequireJS, ReactJS, JSP

* Sightly 

* HTML5, CSS, LESS, SCSS

* IntelliJ, Eclipse

* maven, ant

* Git

I started to write this blog because many many times I find myself searching in google "How to ..." do different stuff. I propose that every time I search something like that to actually write a post where I explain how to solve that respective problem. In this way I will make the life more easy for a person who is searching the same topic as me. I also want to have this blog as a collection of information where I can always come back every time I need to remember some topic which I solved in code. 
I am always open for new challenges and new ideas.
